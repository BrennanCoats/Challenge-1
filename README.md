# Code Refactor 

In this assignment I refactored the css and HTML to make it more readable.
In the CSS file I consolidate alot of code and reorganized it to follow a Semantic structure.
In the HTML file I made small changes to the class names on certain sections to work with the consolidated CSS.
The structure and visuals of the website were not changed due to the refactoring.

Here are a couple of screenshots of the website.
